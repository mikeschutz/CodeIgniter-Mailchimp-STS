CodeIgniter-Mailchimp-STS is a simple CodeIgniter library to interface with the Mailchimp STS API.

Drop the files into your CodeIgniter application folder and insert your Mailchimp API key into the config file, then you're good to go.

NOTE: Limited testing has been done, and *extremely* limited error checking is included.  Use at your own risk.
